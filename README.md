# Personal Statement
I would like to say I hope this country can truly grow after the tragic death of George Floyd. I hope that whoever is reading this can understand that you may not have the same views as the person next to you but everyone deserves respect. No matter your race, sexual orientation, gender, religion, etc. everyone deserves your respect, and shouldn't be treated as if they don't. Hopefully, once we start respecting one another, we can get to the point of loving one another, and accepting our differences. Keep fighting for respect, keep fighting for love, keep fighting for everything good in this country, and hopefully we can grow as a nation.

Thank you,
Ibrahim Kamara

# Background
Being a recent graduate, I simply was curious. I decided to apply some of my skills to a project that applied to my peers and I. I wanted to see does your degree really have an effect on your income, or whether you get a job? We'll let's see!

# Overview
- In this project data will be collected from US Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service on Unemployment, Median Household Income, and Education Attainment
- Raw data will be cleaned and manipulated for visualization and model development
- Lastly, models and visualizations will be translated and interpreted to give data meaning in context of our research question.

# Data Cleaning
- Load the excel files (education and unemployment/income data) into dataframes
- Extract from the dataframes only the columns needed
- Rename the columns so they're easier to manipulate and interpret
- Create a function that let's you insert the state abbreviation and return a dataframe needed for this
- Below is you see exactly what was done:

# Exploratory Data Analysis
- Create a correlation matrix to show the correlation between the varialbles
- Represent the correlation matrix in a heatmap (this was done for fun!). Below you can see and explanation and visual representation of the heatmap
  - With correlation shows how variables are related on a scale of -1 to 1:
    - **1 = Positive correlation:**  indicating a perfect positive correlation meaning as one variable increase so does the other. 
    - **-1 = Negative correlation:** meaning the opposite as one increases the other variable decreases. 
    - **0 = No correlation:**  Meaning that the two variable have no relationship
